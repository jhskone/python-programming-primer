These will be the building blocks you will use to construct your own program. As we progress through the next three days we will build upon each day's content as you are taught the fundamentals of programming. By the end of this 3 morning short course you should be comfortable with basic programming concepts and possess working knowledge of python. You should be comfrotable enough to further explore programming in python on your own and be minimally prepared for the fall's Engineering Analysis course. "
