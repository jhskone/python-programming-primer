There are no installation requirements for your local computer in order to view 
and run any of the ipython notebooks used in this short course. Instead we will 
rely on cloud compute resources that you will connect to through your web browser.
In order to access an interactive environment to view and execute the python 
programming jupyter notebooks, you will need to click the *binder* link at the top
left of this section. This will open up a new browser window tab that will provision 
a lightweight remote cloud resource that will spin up a jupyter notebook server 
for you to interactively work with the notebooks and other contents of this repo.
